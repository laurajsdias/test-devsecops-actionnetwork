### ðŸ”½ Requirements (quick steps to prepare for launching)

1. **AWS CLI with credentials for some AWS account**
Everything will run from a local machine with AWS CLI configured.

2. **Launch script to create bucket and upload 3 files into s3**  
- cd s3-files    
- chmod +x create-s3-bucket.sh      
- ./create-s3-bucket.sh    

3. **Create S3-Read-Only IAM role with this name: S3ReadOnlyAcessTestDevops (MANUAL STEP INSIDE AWS CONSOLE)**  
- Choose IAM service inside AWS CONSOLE  
- Then, choose Roles (right side)  
- Create Function  
- Choose AWS Service > EC2 > Click Next: Permissions   
- Search for S3ReadOnlyAccess and select AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess  
- Click Next: Tags, then click Next: Review   
- Insert this name for the role: S3ReadOnlyAcessTestDevops  
- Click Create Role  
- Done.  

4. **Launch script that generates self-signing certificate and uploads to AWS IAM**

- cd security  
- chmod +x user-data-generate-certificate.sh  
- ./user-data-generate-certificate.sh    

Obs.: Insert the certificate infos, and in Common Name, just insert a dot (.).  
Wait the script end to copy the Arn parameter as in the example below.  
  Example: "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::009009745233:server-certificate/CSC"  
*Copy just the value: arn:aws:iam::009009745233:server-certificate/CSC*

5. **CertificateArn parameter**
- Paste this Arn value from step 4 into CertificateArn parameter in the project/web-servers-stack.yml file.  

6. **ACCOUNT_ID**
- Replace the $ACCOUNT_ID variable (there are two in the web-servers-stack.yml file) for your AWS account ID.

7. **Ok, ready to launch!**

## Launching the VPC-STACK

1. ``cd project``
2. ``./launch-vpc-stack.sh``
3. ``wait for it to end (status of the launching process can be seen on Cloudformation service)``

## Launching the WEB-SERVERS-STACK

1. ``./launch-web-servers.sh``
2. ``wait for it to end (status of the launching process can be seen on Cloudformation service)``
3. ``test by accessing the LoadBalancer on EC2 service. There will be a DNS address``

>>> Importante note: the KeyPair to access the EC2 instances will be generated in this step. It will be the file testdevops-KP.pem inside project directory.

### ðŸ”½ Explanations   

Technologies used: Linux, Cloudformation, S3, some shell script, and a basic IAM setup on AWS.
Motive: to try to use most of your main stack.   

The first thing I noticed is that I would have to automate the creation of VPC and subnets. There are templates that AWS itself provides to launch the type of infra the assignment was asking, but it would result on some manual configuration (like choosing default VPC, subnets, etc on console) and I've tried the most to avoid that.   

In order to create the VPC, I went for a pretty straightforward approach. It is basically one main VPC, 4 subnets and all the resources needed in order for it to work (like internet gateway, routing tables, choosing of availability zones). This VPC is created in the 10.0.0.0/16 network range and it is by default created on us-east-1 region (N. Virginia).    

Cloudformation was the main tool in this project. So I've created a yaml file (vpc-stack.yml) with all the parameters needed to launch this background infrastructure. And, to launch this stack without using the AWS console, all you have to do is to launch a simple script.   

Using Cloudformation as well, I've created the yaml (web-server-stack.yml) for provisioning the web servers asked on the assignment.

The first thing was to assign the VPC created before for this infra based on the parameter **InfrastructureStack**.

Then, it was defined a **LaunchTemplate** so all EC2 instances created were provisioned the same way. 
This was an important step, because of the UserData script going on. This userdata script had two main goals: 
- to install yum-cron in all instances. Goal: schedule daily security and packages updates in all servers. 
- enable a web server (apache) and place the necessary website files inside /var/www/html directory.  

Next steps were to define an **AutoScalingGroup** and a **SecurityGroup**. The AutoScalingGroup defines that this infra will have 3 servers by default, 2 servers at minimum and 5 total and that the subnets created on the vpc-stack will be assigned to this group of instances. The SecurityGroup basically is defining that this infra will accept inbound connections from everyone on ports 22(ssh), 80(http) e 443(https).    

The final part is all the resources needed for a load balancing to happen inside AWS. So it was created the **LoadBalancer** itself associated with our SecurityGroup and the created subnets. Then we enable a **TargetGroup** to listen for connections on port 80 and make healthy checks.  

Furthermore, there are the **Listeners** configuration. There are two: one for HTTP, other for HTTPS. Basically the HTTPListener forward all requests to port 443, and then the HTTPSListener does its job using a self signed certificate that is generated on step 4 of the Requirements step above.

DELIVERED:
- Code to provision almost automatically 3 web servers on AWS via an auto scaling group working behind a load balancer.  
- A basic HTML page with Hello World, date/time, and that also gives names to the instances to test the load balancer working.  
- Encrypted access to the website via the load balancer (using self-signed certificate as an example)  
- A UserData script encoded on the LaunchTemplate that installs yum-cron and uses a customized yum-cron.conf file (uploaded to S3) that schedules security and package updates every 24h.  
- Scripts to create bucket, upload necessary files to S3, generate certificate and do the lauching of the Cloudformation stacks.  
- Security measures such as: using .gitignore to avoid uploading our KeyPair, the generated certificate and its private key to the repository, and using variable $ACCOUNT_ID to avoid credential exposure.

NOT DELIVERED:  
- Automatic scale and descale based on simulated load. But I've tested it manually installing the stress package (install-stress-util-ec2.sh) in all servers and putting manually a threshold for CPU usage and it worked (the command used on the servers was "stress -c 8").    
- Method to automatically update or replace servers upon updates and test them to check if everything is ok before going in 'production'.   

IDEAS TO MAKE MORE PRODUCTION-READY:
- Improve the process so it has minimal manual steps. For example:  
 . create the S3-Read-Only IAM Role through the web-servers-stack (i've tried, I left the code commented under S3ReadOnlyRole resource, but I'm missing some detail and it's not working).   
 . use Cloudformation to provision the infra and code automatically in an ElasticBeanStack environment, and remove the step of uploading the files to S3.  
- Use Certificate Manager and Route 53 to better manage the certificate being used in production and create a proper DNS for the website.
